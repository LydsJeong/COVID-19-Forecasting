# COVID-19-Forecasting

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In this project, we will model spread of the coronavirus and study how we can project and plan for best and worst case scenarios as we are in the midst of the 2nd wave. 
<br><br>
The dataset we will be using to accomplish this is the COVID-19 Data Repository from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. 
<br><br>
The goal of this project is to develop data science or machine learning models that forecast COVID-19 cases with the aim of helping policymakers plan for the days and months ahead, and take action to change the course of the pandemic for the better.
